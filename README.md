## What is Instaclone?

Instaclone is an experiment to better understand how to build, manage, develop, and deploy an understandably complex system like Instagram. Instaclone tries to mimic not only the UI/UX of Instagram, but the backend as well.

## What can Instaclone do?

You can create, view, edit, and delete posts on Instaclone, much like Instagram. For doing this, you should have an account at Instaclone. This can be done by signing up at Instaclone.

At the moment Instaclone comprises only of a web app, but in the future, Instaclone will be available on multiple platforms including mobile and as an API.

## How does Instaclone do it?

Instaclone is powered by a variety of open source tools, including but not limited to:

1. [Django][1]: Django is the web framework of choice. It is a very powerful framework which can be used to convert ideas quickly to production.

2. [Nginx][2]: Nginx is used as a production-grade web server and a reverse proxy.

3. [Gunicorn][3]: Gunicorn is the WSGI server which communicates between Django and Nginx.

4. [RabbitMQ][4]: RabbitMQ is the message broker which is used for sending messages to distributed task queues.

5. [Celery][5]: Celery is the distributed task queue which processes messages from the message broker and performs actions (like sending emails) asynchronously, outside the HTTP Request-Response cycle.

6. [Docker][6]: Docker (and Compose) is used to containerize and run the components which make up Instaclone.

## What is Instaclone not?

Instaclone is **NOT** and never will be:

1. A replacement/competitor to any social media/messaging, app/service.

2. A service meant for consumption by general public.

3. Expected to make money.

4. Expected to be driven by traffic generated by human users.

5. Having a business model.

## Who are behind Instaclone?

Well, I am.

At the moment, the project is solely run by me. I am a full time working employee at a firm and the work behind Instaclone is done during my spare time as a hobby. This involves planning, designing, implementing, testing, and deploying Instaclone.

However, this can get a bit overwhelming at times. An extra pair of hands are always appreciated. :slightly_smiling_face:
